# Hi! here's a mate for you 🧉

I'm a web developer **in progress**. In these repos you'll find training code, side projects and random stuff that I like to push.

I'm currently working at [Acciona IT](https://www.acciona-it.com/) as SSR Software Engineer. Since 2022 I'm also pursuing a [technical degree in Software Development](https://www.ifts18.edu.ar/carreras/tsds/plan-tsds) at a public school in Buenos Aires.

**[ Tools that I'm using and learning ]** 

👷 for work: HTML, MySQL, Jira + Confluence

👓 for school: Python, sqlite3, OOP

🐧 for fun: Linux, Bash, Docker, Github actions

👾 misc learning: JavaScript (mostly React & Vue), PHP (mostly Wordpress)
